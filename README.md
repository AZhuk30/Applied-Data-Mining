##  Overview  
This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of 100,000 records. We evaluated five models (Logistic Regression, C5.0, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, CART) and identified **Random Forest** as the optimal solution with **95.94% accuracy** and **86.85% precision**.
