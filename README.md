With the growing use of digital payments, credit card fraud has become a serious concern for both consumers and financial institutions. With the increase in credit card transactions comes more attempts to exploit these systems and users. The ability to accurately and quickly identify fraudulent transactions is essential to protecting usersâ€™ sensitive information and maintaining trust between customers and companies. Data mining can offer powerful tools and algorithms for analyzing large amounts of transaction data to accurately identify fraud (Dal Pozzolo et al., 2018). 
This paper evaluates a dataset containing data for 100,000 credit card transactions collected from October 13th to October 14th, 2020 (Verna, 2023).
